# Getting Involved

Code patches are not the only way to get involved: you can help the project by reporting bugs; improving docs; helping
others on [GitHub Issues](issues); tweeting to [@EC2U_Alliance](https://twitter.com/EC2U_Alliance); telling the world
about EC2U ;-)

# Reporting Bugs

Before opening an [issue](issues) to report a bug, search open issues for similar cases and, if something is found, 
just add any additional details in the comments.

If you've really found a new bug, creating a helpful report using the dedicated template will make fixing it much
easier and quicker.

If you just want some help, start a [discussion](discussions) and describe your problem.

# Suggesting Features

If you think you have a good idea about improving or extending @ec2u/node, feel free to open
an [issue](issues), using the dedicated template.

Again search open suggestions and, if something is found, just add any additional details in the comments.
