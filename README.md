# EC2U Virtual Card

The EC2U Virtual Card is a lightweight mobile-based academic identification card built on top of two mature and 
widespread identity management systems:

* the [European Student Card](https://europeanstudentcard.eu/) (ESC) framework 
* the [eduGAIN](https://edugain.org) federated identity network


## Users

Faculty, students and staff registered with eduGAIN may be easily provided with a virtual card and 
access it using personal credentials issued by their home institution.

Cardholders can demonstrate their academic affiliation and status by presenting their virtual card to local
academic, public or commercial service providers.

Service providers may verify card integrity and validity by scanning its QR code
and automatically retrieve authoritative data about the card and its holder from to the central ESC server. 


## Privacy

The EC2U Virtual Card doesn't permanently store any personal information: all data required to render virtual cards are 
dynamically retrieved from central ESC facilities on the basis of a personal identification codes provided by the
 eduGAIN identity federation; both systems store personal information in compliance with the European General Data 
 Protection Regulation (GDPR).
