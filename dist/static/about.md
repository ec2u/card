# Service

The EC2U Virtual Card is a lightweight mobile-based academic identification card built on top of two mature and
widespread identity management systems:

- the [European Student Card](https://europeanstudentcard.eu/) (ESC) framework
- the [eduGAIN](https://edugain.org/) federated identity network

# Users

Faculty, students and staff registered with eduGAIN may be easily provided with a virtual card and access it using
personal credentials issued by their home institution.

Cardholders can demonstrate their academic affiliation and status by presenting their virtual card to local academic,
public or commercial service providers.

Service providers may verify card integrity and validity by scanning its QR code and automatically retrieve authoritative
data about the card and its holder from to the central ESC server.

# Management

Mobility operators at partner universities issue and manage virtual cards directly on the central ESC management system
using their institutional accounts.

Partner universities may opt to delegate the EC2U Connect Centre to operate on their behalf on the central ESC management
system, in order to retrieve card details required to render virtual cards on mobile devices.

cards are dynamically retrieved from central ESC facilities on the basis of a personal identification codes provided by
the eduGAIN identity federation; both systems store personal information in compliance with the European General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR).
